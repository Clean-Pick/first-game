# My first Godot game


I'm learning to use Godot and followed the basic game instructions from the docs, feel free to play.


## How to use


Just download first game.exe in the "build" folder and run it.


I'm very bad at this game, my highscore is about 25 or so, see if you can beat me :)


### How to play


You have to dodge the creeps by using the arrow keys on your keyboard or by using a controller, good luck.
